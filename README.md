# HR-3DXRD
ImageD11 and pyFAI-based py scripts for High Resolution 3DXRD

A simulation package for verification and realization of an enhaced spatial resolution variety of 3D X-ray diffraction microscopy (ref. H.F. Poulsen, Three-dimensional X-ray Diffraction Microscopy, 2004, doi: 10.1007/B97884).

This package utilizes scripts from ImageD11 (https://github.com/FABLE-3DXRD/ImageD11), PolyXSim (https://github.com/FABLE-3DXRD/PolyXSim) and pyFAI (https://github.com/silx-kit/pyFAI). All scripts were written in Python 2.7.
